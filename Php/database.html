      <p>With PHP, we can connect to and manipulate databases.</p>
      <p>
        <span>MySQL</span> is the most popular database system used with PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Databases are useful for storing information categorically. A company
        may have a database with the following tables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Employees</li>
        <li>Products</li>
        <li>Customers</li>
        <li>Orders</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>Connect to MySQL</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphBox">
      <p>We can work with a MySQL database using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MySQLi extension (the "i" stands for improved)</li>
        <li>PDO (PHP Data Objects)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><b>MySQLi or PDO</b></h2>
      <p>Both MySQLi and PDO have their advantages:</p>
      <p>
        <span>PDO</span> will work on 12 different database systems, whereas
        MySQLi will only work with MySQL databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have to switch your project to use another database,
        <span>PDO</span> makes the process easy. You only have to change the
        connection string and a few queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <span>MySQLi</span>, you will need to rewrite the entire code -
        queries included.
      </p>
      <p>Both are object-oriented, but MySQLi also offers a procedural API.</p>
      <p>
        Both support Prepared Statements. Prepared Statements protect from SQL
        injection, and are very important for web application security.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this, and in the following chapters we demonstrate three ways of
        working with PHP and MySQL:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>MySQLi (object-oriented)</li>
        <li>MySQLi (procedural)</li>
        <li>PDO</li>
      </ul>
